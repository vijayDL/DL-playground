    "Understanding backpropagation is important in understanding how deep neural nets work.Given the Loss function L, we are interested in finding the gradients of variables with respect to the loss. Instead of deriving gradients with chain rule, which can be tedious for very large network, we can think of the neural network as a computational graph and figure out how gradient flows at each of the units. Once we know how gradients flow across each of the units, then its simple to grasp backpropagation without writing out derivatives using chain rule. Remember, this is still chain rule at work, but developing this new intuation, will make it easier to undertand really large and complex networks.\n",
